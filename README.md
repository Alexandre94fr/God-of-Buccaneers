## ➤ Context of the game's creation :
- This "game" is a study project at La Horde were I had to create a "game" in 5 weeks (less than 100 hours of pure work in reality {without courses, and with schedule changes}), I was the only student programmers working on this project, all the documents who were created in the process are in the [Documents folder](https://github.com/Alexandre94fr/God-of-Buccaneers/tree/main/Documents).
Note that the island's shader was made after due, in two day.

- If I choose to put quotes around the word "game" it's because I choosed to focus not on making a game, but on making an advance procedural island archipel system, learning to use shaders, and other things like Abstraction and use of Events. After all, the objectif of a school is to learn, right ?
